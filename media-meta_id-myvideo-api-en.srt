Hi, today I've prepared for you a small example of a video that is associated with three different tracks.

1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:20,800
Two for subtitles, in English and in German, and one track for chapters.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,630
First, before going further, let's look at how this is rendered in different browsers. With Google Chrome,

3
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:38,500
we've got a CC button here, that will enable or disable subtitles. What we can see

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:46,020
is that by default the subtitles that are displayed are in German (in this example).

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,239
And I can just switch them on and off. It loaded the first track that has the default

6
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,710
attribute. And I have no menu for choosing what track, what language I want to be displayed here …

7
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,210
If we look at FireFox, it's even worse!

8
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:16,009
We don't have any menu at all, no CC button. I cannot switch on the subtitles, because

9
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:25,600
as of December 2015, FireFox will load only the first track, if it has the default attribute.

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,650
This is not the case, so we don't have any subtitles and we cannot display them.

11
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,570
With Safari, on my Mac, it's better because I've got a subtitle menu and I can choose between

12
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:49,860
the different tracks. I can switch to English subtitles, and english subtitles will be displayed.

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,430
I'm on a MacIntosh so I cannot show you... but with other browsers like Internet Explorer

14
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:07,939
or Microsoft Edge, there are situations similar to Safari. So, what can be do to increase

15
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:15,080
the features of the default player? We can use what we call the Track API, for asking

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:23,050
which tracks are available, activating them, and so on. Now, I would like to remind you

17
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,150
the structure of a track. I'm just going to display the content of one of these tracks.

18
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:40,480
The tracks are made of cues and what we call a cue is a kind of time segment that is defined

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,599
with a starting time and an ending time. And the cue can have an ID, in that case it

20
00:02:47,599 --> 00:03:00,420
is a numeric ID (1, 2, 3), and a content that can be HTML with bold, italic elements

21
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,310
and it can also be a voice so when you see "v" followed by the name of the character

22
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,239
that is speaking, it’s a voice. So, we are going to look at what we can do

23
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,680
with such tracks during the course and we will see how to handle a chapter menu,

24
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,690
how to display a nice transcript on the side of the video, that you can click to jump at the

25
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:37,480
exact time the video tells the words that are on the transcript. And we will see also

26
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,239
how to choose the subtitle or caption track language for the video.

27
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:52,739
So, this is finished for this small introduction video, I will just conclude by this thing

28
00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:01,610
here: explaining this crossOrigin="anonymous". We saw that during the HTML5 Part 1 course

29
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:09,230
and many people asked questions about this. This is because of security constraints.

30
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:16,000
In browsers, when you've got the HTML page that is on a different location than the video file

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,880
and the tracks files, you will have security constraints errors. And if your server is configured

32
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:36,860
for accepting different origins, then you can add this attribute crossOrigin="anonymous"

33
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:47,440
in your HTML document and it is going to work. So the server here: mainline.i3s.unice.fr has been

34
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:59,180
configured for allowing external HTML pages to include the videos it hosts and the subtitles

35
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:07,970
it hosts, this is the reason. You can use the DropBox public directory here

36
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:18,449
because Dropbox also enables cross origin requests. So this is all for this first video,

37
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:19,310
I see you in the next one!
